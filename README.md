experimental real time lighting for gorilla tag

to open the ui to place lights, and change values, press v on your keyboard

make sure to save your lights that you added once done

to load previously saved lights, just input the json into the menu (opened by v)

if you spawn too many lights, your game [b]WILL[/b] lag.

have fun and report issues in the [i]issues[/i] tab at the top, or submit [i]pull requests[/i] if you actually know how to code lol
