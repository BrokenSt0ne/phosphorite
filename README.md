A WIP Experimental real-time lighting mod for Gorilla Tag using the GorillaCorp lighting.

## Features
* Realtime lighting using the GorillaCorp lighting.
* Full control over:
  * Light Positions
  * Color
  * Intensities
* Load/save lights via JSON
* Simple in-game UI
* Works in both **modded** and **non-modded** lobbies since it doesnt give an advantage.
* Changing already created lights.

## Usage
You create and load lights via a menu opened by pressing the `V` key on your keyboard (they do *not* autoload as of now).

In the UI you should be greeted with options for position, intensity and color and a couple utility buttons beneath.

To load a json, click the `Load Lights from JSON` button in the ui. [Heres a good example of a json.](https://github.com/BrokenSt0ne/phosphorite/blob/main/data.json) *(note that it must be called data.json as of now and placed inside the folder your phosphorite plugin is in)*

**Warning**: Spawning too many lights will cause lag. Use wisely.

**If it doesn't look like it's working, set your ambient color to #000000 and add a light at your location**
