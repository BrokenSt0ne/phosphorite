# phosphorite
experimental real time lighting for gorilla tag

## usage
to open the ui to create lights/remove lights, press v on your keyboard

make sure to save your lights that you added once done

to load a json, click the `Load Lights from JSON` button in the ui. heres a good example of a json: 
[link to the json](https://github.com/BrokenSt0ne/phosphorite/blob/main/exampleLights.json)

the lights from this json are in city, first go there and then load.

if you spawn too many lights, your game ***WILL*** lag, depending on how much lights there are.

have fun and report issues in the *issues* tab at the top, or submit *pull requests* if you actually know how to code lol
