A WIP Experimental real-time lighting mod for Gorilla Tag using the GorillaCorp lighting.

## Usage
You create and load lights via a menu opened by pressing the `V` key on your keyboard (they do *not* autoload as of now).

In the UI you should be greeted with options for position, intensity and color and a couple utility buttons beneath.

To load a json, click the `Load Lights from JSON` button in the ui. [Heres a good example of a json.](https://github.com/BrokenSt0ne/phosphorite/blob/main/data.json) *(note that it must be called data.json as of now and placed inside the "phosphorite" folder in your root bepinex folder and the example is only in city)*

**If you don't have a folder called "phosphorite" in your root BepInEx folder, create it manually and drag the data.json inside.**

If you spawn too many lights, your game ***WILL*** lag, depending on how many lights there are.

Report issues in the *issues* tab at the top, or submit *pull requests* if you actually know how to code lol

also this mod works outside moddeds as it gives literally 0 advantage lmfao
